# Java Programming Practice

Welcome to my Java Programming Practice repository! This repository is dedicated to practicing core Java concepts, object-oriented programming, multithreading, collections, file handling, basics of programming, and mini projects.

## Core Java Concepts

In this section, you will find exercises and examples covering fundamental Java concepts such as:

- Variables and Data Types
- Operators
- Control Flow (if-else, switch, loops)
- Methods and Functions
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation

## Object-Oriented Concepts

Here, we delve deeper into object-oriented programming principles, including:

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Interfaces
- Design Patterns

## Multithreading

Understanding concurrent programming is crucial in Java development. In this section, we explore:

- Threads and Runnable Interface
- Thread Synchronization
- Deadlocks and Race Conditions
- Thread Pools
- Asynchronous Programming

## Collections

Java Collections framework provides a set of classes and interfaces for storing and manipulating groups of objects. Topics covered include:

- Lists
- Sets
- Maps
- Queues
- Iterators
- Sorting and Searching

## File Handling

File handling is essential for reading from and writing to files. This section covers:

- Reading and Writing Text Files
- File Input/Output Streams
- Serialization and Deserialization
- File Handling Best Practices

## Basics of Programming

Here, we cover fundamental programming concepts that apply not only to Java but to programming in general. Topics include:

- Variables and Data Types
- Control Structures
- Functions and Methods
- Recursion
- Error Handling

## Mini Projects

Putting theory into practice is essential for mastering Java. In this section, you will find small projects to apply the concepts learned throughout the repository. Projects may include:

- Simple Calculator
- Address Book Application
